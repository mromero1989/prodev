			<h2>WEEKLY REFLECTIONS</h2>
			<h3>Week 0</h3>
			<p>Overall week 0 has been fascinating and I'm slowly finding coming here routine. It was somewhat frightening coming to class because I wasn't sure what to expect. Although it has been hard it is also fun. My only problem is not getting simple instructions because I tend to over think or not fully recognize what I need to do. Although I might take longer than some to learn I feel like dedication and perseverance will get me though this bootcamp. So far, I'm feeling good.</p>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>Week 1 started on a good note and moved into uncharted territory. My number one problem is getting tired around 3. My mind stops working and I stop listening to the lectures. I get home and I'm tired which prevents me from taking in and understanding the material. I am also having fun and can't wait to understand everything. It's my wanting to learn that keeps me driven. I imagine the life I am going to have after this bootcamp and I want to see myself go far in life. It's hard and fun at the same time. I see a lot of people in the same position and it makes me feel less alone. I can't wait to actively work on group projects and see the results of our hard work. I really wish I had a tutor so I can understand the concepts more. I am slightly behind but I know I have to work harder if I want to succeed. </p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week has been great overall. I submitted my ideas for an app and had two actually selected. Our team for the capstone is amazing! I am excited to be working with them all. I am also happy that I got to work on my own idea and that makes this project more than just coding, it's passion. My goal for the next week is to learn more and to get most of what I don't now down. This week has been hard and stressful but also really good. I am getting to know most of peers a little more. We are all in this together and a lot of us rely on each other to succeed because you can't without teamwork.</p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>This week has been stressful. I feel like I'm not learning like I want to. I feel behind and not ahead. This was for sure a long week. What added to my stress was my anxiety. It floods in from time to time and the only thing I can do is put some music on and breathe. My head stops taking in input. I get anxiety all the time but sometimes I feel like I am going to throw up and my heads starts hurting and I can't think. I also suffer from depression which doesn't help. On the bad days it's hard to even want to wake up. I wish I could be like others and speed though this and conquer the world. It's hard when I can't have my brain do what it should. This week has also shown me that people are not understanding with the conditions I have. I feel lost and lonely a lot of the time. I see normal people and how they can smile and do whatever they want. It's hard when I feel sick and my body and mind hurts. I get brain fog and after 8 hours of lectures I go home and just want to hide. I want to sleep even though I know I can be doing more. I want to succeed and I want to begin a new life. I want to do my best in this program. I want to make a great app that makes the world better. I have to conquer my fears but I'm worried my weaknesses are going to bury me. </p>
			<h3>Direct/Indirect Marketing</h3>
			<p>My direct/indirect marketing was asking for a business card from an owner of a food truck in hopes to network with him and to help him be involved in a future app endeavor of mine. I also received a phone number of a photographer.</p>
			<h3>Forbidden Island Game</h3>
			<p>I've never played this game before and I had a lot of fun. I especially like how it works as a team effort. In order to win the game everyone must work together or fail. Calder and Nick knew the game and helped us learn. We read through the documentation and tried our luck at it. I needed a little more time to get the hang of it but trusted Calder and Nick to help us through. I noticed as we were playing that Calder and Nick told us what to do rather then work as a team to come up with a resolution. Instead of working slow and making sure everyone had a voice, we went rather fast and ultimately failed. A lot of it had to do with luck and also me and Marcus didn't get to utilize our card to the best of our abilities. It was a learning experience and it showed me a lot of detail on how our team works. I love our team because we have so much to give to each other. I feel like if we can bring out the best of each other then we cannot fail.</p>
